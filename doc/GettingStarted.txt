=Getting started=

==Introduction==

The main class you will need to use for console is `C`, (`com.atticmedia.console.C`). `C` is a static / singleton adapter for `Console` (`com.atticmedia.console.Console`). 

In a later date when you don't need console in your flash project, you can just remove `C.start(..)` from your code and the rest of console related codes will stop executing to save memory and performance.


==Basics==

If you want to set a keyword for console to start, assign at second parameter. 
Use letters and numbers only. Console will start hidden if you set a password.
You will need to type the keyword in correct sequence to show the console.
Recommended keyword: ` or # or ~

{{{
import com.atticmedia.console.C;
C.start(this, "");
}}}

If you are using Flex, it may be easier to start console on stage, using C.startOnStage(), where first parameter can be any display/UIComponent which is already on stage or to be added later.

{{{
import com.atticmedia.console.C;
C.startOnStage(this);
}}}

Logging...

{{{
//
// basic logging
//
C.info("Hello world");
C.log("A log message for console.", "optionally there", "can be", "multiple arguments");
C.debug("A debug level log");
C.warn("This is a warning log");
C.error("This is an error log.", "multiple arguments are supported", "for above basic logging methods");
//
// basic channel logging
//
C.infoch("myChannel", "Hello myChannel");
C.logch("myChannel", "A log message at myChannel", "optionally there", "can be", "multiple arguments");
C.debugch("myChannel", "A debug level log");
C.warnch("myChannel", "This is a warning log");
C.errorch("myChannel", "This is an error log.", "multiple arguments are supported", "for above basic logging methods");
//
//
}}}

==Advanced==

====Command line====

  * Write `/help` in command line area for short syntex help.
  * Read CommandLineHelp for detailed info on how to take advantage of Command Line.

====Garbage collection monitor====
{{{
import flash.display.Sprite;
var aSprite = new Sprite();
C.watch(aSprite, "aSprite");
aSprite = null;
}}}
Above example creates a Sprite and then remove its reference. This marks the Sprite to be garbage collected, but it will probably never get collected straight away.
If you have a debugger version of flash player installed, you can press G in console menu (press @ at top) to force garbage collect. 
If you start using this in fairly big flash project, you will see that objects that have lost reference to will properly get collected and notified in console.


==Optionals==
{{{

// enable remoting broadcast
// start broadcasting logs. It will also keep logging for it self
// it can not be a remote while it is remoting...
C.remoting = true;

// recieve remoting broadcasts
// start logging broadcasted logs from another swf.
// it can not be remoting while it is a remote...
C.remote = true;



// Change viewing channel
// This is the same as pressing the channel on channels tab at the top.
C.viewingChannel = "myChannel";

// pause console
// This is the same as pressing P button from console menu
// It will keep logging but will stop all update processes
C.paused = true;

// hide console
// It will keep logging but will stop all update processes
C.visible = false;

// disable console
// It will stop all processes until you enable by code again
C.enabled = false;

// disable always on top (default is on)
// when disabled console will stop from keeping it self at the top of the display list
// this can sometimes fix some problems if you need to manage the display list
C.alwaysOnTop = false;
