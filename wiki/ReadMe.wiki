== Change Log ==
===1.02===
  * *Multiple channel selections*: At run time holding down shift key or in code pass with comma delimiters, such as `C.viewingChannel = "shell,game";`
  * *Strong referencing*: Now you can set console to work in strong referencing. In command line type `/strong true` or in code. `C.strongRef = true;` This is useful when you are trying to store objects that will not persist for the time you need to debug with. But be careful as these items will not get garbage collected.
  * *Improved auto-scroll*: While you have scrolled up from the bottom of log, it will no longer auto-scroll back to the bottom when new log line is added. A red line flashes at the bottom everytime there is a new line.
