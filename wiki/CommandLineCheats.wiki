#summary CommandLine cheats


Some useful command line code...


==Reduce frame rate==

(replace `5` with your own choice...

`$base.stage.frameRate = 5`


==Log key presses==
`$base.stage.addEventListener(flash.events.KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, $C.log)`

Key presses while focused on command line will be ignored as it has `Event .stopPropagation()` applied.


==Copy to clipboard==

(replace `$returned` with a variable/string you want to save)

`flash.system.System.setClipboard($returned)`



==Maths==
From version 2.31 you can execute operations on the fly, therefore maths on demand.

  * Simple: `10-(5/2)`
  * Assignment: `stage.frameRate *= 1.5`
  * Advanced: `(90*Math.PI)/180` - _ 90 degree in radians _
  * Bitwise:`2761 & 234`
