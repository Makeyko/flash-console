#summary CommandLine cheats


Some useful command line code...


==Reduce frame rate==

(replace `5` with your own choice...

`$base.stage.frameRate = 5`


==Log key presses==
`$base.stage.addEventListener(flash.events.KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, $C.log)`

Key presses while focused on command line will be ignored as it has `Event .stopPropagation()` applied.


==Copy to clipboard==

(replace `$model.toString()` with a variable/string you want to save)

`flash.system.System.setClipboard($model.toString())`
