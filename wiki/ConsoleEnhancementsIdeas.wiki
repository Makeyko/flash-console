==Console Enhancements Ideas==

 * Support Flex debugging like logging method. (like making channel instances with package path)
 * Support for easier priority logs, such as C.debug(...) or C.error(...) - channel support on top?

 * Do a video or so to demonstrate the use of Console

=== Implementing for version 2.1===
 * Better Command Line syntax reading - currently can't handle nested calls and strings with spaces

===Implemented in version 2.0===
 * Data graphing - such as showing FPS in graph and add multiple graphs of your own data
 * Display Roller to capture current display map on key/mouse click, for better examination of the map - click on display name to get instance of the clip for command line use. - and also print mouseX and mouseY in the list.

 * Memory monitor should have option to show in MB, and also have reset button.
 * FPS to show in a more visual way for easier comparison.
 * Ruler mode should have a horizontal and vertical line following the mouse to be useful in alignment testing
 * Improve menu system. - currently a LOT of people don't know what the menu button keys stand for.
